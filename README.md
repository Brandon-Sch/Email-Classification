# Email Classification

This project uses the naive Bayes classification to
classify emails in spam and not spam categories. 

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned how to use naive Bayes classification for machine learning. This was my first time working on a machine-learning project and it was very informative. I struggled the most on finding the likelihood of each word whether it was spam or not spam.
