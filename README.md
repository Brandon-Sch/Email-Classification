# Email Classification

This project uses the naive Bayes classification to
classify emails in spam and not spam categories. 

## Lessons Learned

In this project, I learned how to use multiple Python
packages including Pandas, Numpy, and Sklearn. I also learned basic machine learning. This was my first time working on a machine-learning project and it was very informative. I struggled the most on working with the data table as I am not familiar with it.
